ReconTask:
  description: >
    Perform initial reconnaissance to gather raw cyber threat data
    from public intelligence sources.
  expected_output: >
    Structured JSON containing recent CVEs, security news entries,
    and public GitHub exploit repositories.
  agent: ReconAgent
  phase: Phase 1 - Reconnaissance


ClassificationTask:
  description: >
    Analyze normalized threats and assign high-level threat categories
    using deterministic, rule-based logic.
  expected_output: >
    Enriched threats annotated with a threat category
    such as RCE, PRIV_ESC, DOS, or UNKNOWN.
  agent: ClassificationAgent
  phase: Phase 2 - Threat Understanding


SeverityScoringTask:
  description: >
    Compute operational severity scores for classified threats,
    taking into account exploit availability, impact, and freshness.
  expected_output: >
    Enriched threats with severity scores (0.0–10.0),
    severity levels, and human-readable rationale.
  agent: SeverityAgent
  phase: Phase 2 - Threat Understanding


CorrelationAndDecisionTask:
  description: >
    Correlate threats across multiple intelligence sources,
    deduplicate overlapping issues, and assign operational decisions.
  expected_output: >
    Deduplicated and prioritized threats annotated with decisions
    such as ESCALATE, TRACK, or IGNORE.
  agent: DecisionAgent
  phase: Phase 3 - Decision & Prioritization


ReportingTask:
  description: >
    Generate a human-readable threat intelligence report
    and archive historical reports for auditability.
  expected_output: >
    Markdown report summarizing escalated, tracked, and suppressed
    threats, along with execution metadata.
  agent: ReportingAgent
  phase: Phase 4 - Reporting
